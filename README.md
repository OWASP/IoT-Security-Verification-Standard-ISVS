The OWASP Internet of Things Security Verification Standard (ISVS) is a community effort to establish an open standard of security requirements for Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. The requirements provided by the ISVS can be used at many stages during the Development Life Cycle including design, development, and testing of IoT ecosystems.

IoT ecosystems are often complex collections of many interconnected systems. Some of these interconnected systems are IoT systems, containing connected devices and their components, both software and hardware. Others examples of systems in IoT ecosystems are web or mobile applications and cloud components. 

The ISVS focuses on providing security requirements for IoT systems and their components: IoT hardware, software, embedded applications and communication protocols. It also provides some general requirements for the IoT ecosystems in which IoT systems reside, while referring to existing industry-accepted standards as much as possible.
