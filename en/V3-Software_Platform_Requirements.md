# V3: Software Platform Requirements

## Control Objective

The bootloader is the first piece of code to run during the device's boot process. The firmware manufacturer is responsible for configuring bootloaders correctly otherwise its vulnerabilities can undermine the security of the entire device, leading to compromise and device hijacking. Controls in this chapter ensure boot trustworthiness by verifying cryptographic signatures on the loaded code, not allowing loading images from external locations, and disallowing memory, shell, and other debug access during boot.

The operating system, and its kernel, in particular, are central for device security, as they run in privileged mode and implement critical device functionality, including many security primitives. This necessitates best security practices for the operating system, kernel configuration, and hardening.

The Linux operating system is one of the most popular in IoT. It has many features from first-line security to defense-in-depth, including the isolation mechanisms supported by namespaces and cgroups, and additional kernel security modules for access controls. Leverage these isolation mechanisms when configuring and deploying third-party applications to run within a container.

Updating and maintaining device software is crucial to product security. Update systems must employ security best practices as part of their design and implementation to ensure devices only run cryptographically signed software free of known vulnerabilities. PPatch and vulnerability management processes ensure the latest available versions deploy new builds with upstream security patches to protect end-users from compromise.

Securely configuring and integrating hardware security chips into software platforms allows devices to use a cryptographically asserted identity burned into the chip at manufacturing time. Security chips add more functionality providing privileged storage locations to store keys or secrets encrypted at rest.
