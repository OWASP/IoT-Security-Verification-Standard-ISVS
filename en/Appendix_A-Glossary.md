- **Cryptographic material** -   All material, including documents, devices, or equipment that contains cryptographic information and is essential to the encryption, decryption, or authentication of communications.
- **Device** - Endpoint device that is capable of storing, generating, and processing data. A generic IoT device will incorporate sensors, actuators and potentially a user interface.  
- **Firmware** - Software that communicates with a device's hardware components through instructions and application interfaces.
- **[GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html)** - General Public License that allows freedom to use software for any purpose, freedom to change the software, freedom to share the software, and freedom to share the changes made.

- **PCB** - A **printed circuit board** is a board that contains lines (traces) and pads that connect components together via electrical signals.
- **Privileged locations** - An area in hardware or software that requires elevated access and permission sets.
- **Security chip** - Security chips provide the foundation for secure boot, secure storage, encrypting data at rest, and are the basis for a hardware root of trust. They are often coprocessors within system on chips (SoC) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) but are also referred to as trusted platform modules (TPM), and secure enclaves.
- **Sensitive information** - Data that requires protection against unauthorized access such as personal identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), card holder data, private keys, credentials, and personal data as defined by The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
