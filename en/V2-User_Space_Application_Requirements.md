# V2: User Space Application Requirements

## Control Objective

The purpose of the controls listed in this chapter is to ensure secure access to an IoT system by users and machines and to protect sensitive data by using security best practices.

Authentication and authorization are necessary to secure access. Relevant controls include strong unique secure identity, user role segregation, and the concept of least privilege. Authentication is the act of establishing, or confirming, the identity of someone (or something) as authentic, as a basis to believe that claims made by a person or about a device are correct and resistant to impersonation. Additional necessary controls include preventing recovery or interception of authentication credentials such as passwords, API keys, and private keys. Authorization is the act of establishing, or confirming  someone (or something) has access rights to resources or actions satisfying the secure access policy.

Protection of sensitive data, including credentials, and the fair treatment of private information are necessary to ensure secure use of system resources, such as files containing data or code, and the contents of memory.

Many controls in this chapter are implemented through cryptography. Therefore, additional controls are necessary to select the right cryptographic primitives and configure them with secure credential storage.

| **2.1.10** | Verify that provisioned credentials for device authentication are unique per device. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.1.11** | Verify that authentication schemes are designed to revoke credentials of compromised or decommissioned devices. | | | ✓ |

### Authorization

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 |
| --  | ---------------------- | - | - | - |
| **2.2.1** | Verify that IoT system accounts across users, services and devices share a common authorization framework. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.2.2** | Verify that devices enforce the concept of least privilege by limiting applications and services that run as root or administrator. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.2.3** | Verify that ownership is validated upon registration and as part of decommissioning when devices move across accounts (e.g. device reselling, leasing, and renting).  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.2.4** | Verify that device debug capabilities can only be accessed by approved staff (e.g. support and engineering teams) and verify that access is monitored or logged. | | ✓ | ✓ |


### Data Protection

| **2.3.2** | Verify that in case a device is decommissioned, or the owner changes, all sensitive information such as PII data and credentials can be removed from the device. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.3.3** | Verify that in case a device is decommissioned, or the owner changes, it is marked as such in a centrally managed database in the ecosystem for audit purposes. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.3.4** | Verify that sensitive information maintained in memory is overwritten with zeros as soon as it is no longer required. | | ✓ | ✓ |
