## About the Standard

The OWASP Internet of Things Security Verification Standard (ISVS) is a community effort to establish an open standard of security requirements for Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. IoT ecosystems comprise of different systems, including IoT systems (connected devices, IoT applications and their supporting infrastructure) and other systems, such as web and mobile applications. The requirements provided by the ISVS target both IoT ecosystems as a whole, and IoT systems specifically: IoT hardware, software, applications and communication protocols. These requirements can be used during many stages of the Development Life Cycle, including design, development, and testing of IoT ecosystems.

The IoT Security Verification Standard is built upon the hard work of volunteers and contributors. The project originated as part of an appendix by the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) and it was decided the topic of IoT needed its own standard.
