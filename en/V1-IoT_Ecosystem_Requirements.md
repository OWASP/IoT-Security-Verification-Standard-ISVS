# V1: IoT Ecosystem Requirements

## Control Objective

System security design performed before development, and a security process that continuously supports system development integrated into all phases of its life cycle, are necessary fundamentals for creating secure product architecture implementations. Iterative system threat modeling provides a means to prepare for malintent and develop mitigation plans as part of product design life cycles.

A secure development process ensures the identification and documentation of all sensitive information and functionality required for an IoT ecosystem, enforces all the security controls at the determined level, and ensures that end-users and customers get notified about vulnerabilities and that security solutions deliver on time. Ensure that sister OWASP verification standards, provided in the references section below, are incorporated as part of development processes.

The supply chain has vital importance for the security of every IoT product. A secure development process verifies that all security requirements for suppliers and third-party code implement controls with the appropriate security level and development-time features are not left on devices, exposing them to vulnerabilities.

To ensure the security of all software produced, the build process for the system software must be done in a secure build environment that verifies the integrity and authenticity of all components. The code must be written using best security practices and compiled using the best security options available.

System configuration changes must employ appropriate logging and monitoring capabilities to provide audit trails for security events. Attributes detailing events aid with investigations while overly verbose logs containing sensitive information introduce security risks.

## Security Verification Requirements

### Application and Ecosystem Design

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 |
| -- | ---------------------- | - | - | - |
| **1.1.1** | Verify that the IoT system is developed with the level of security (L1, L2, or L3) applicable to its capabilities and risks posed by the environment where it is deployed. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.1.2** | Verify that all components and communication channels in the IoT ecosystem have been identified and are known to be needed. Remove or disable any that aren't necessary. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.1.3** | Verify the use of threat modeling as part of each product introduction design (i.e. new and mature) and security-relevant feature changes to identify likely threats and facilitate appropriate risk responses to guide security testing. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.1.4** | Verify that security controls are enforced server-side and that data and instructions are not blindly trusted by server-side components. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.1.5** | Verify that a responsible disclosure policy has been established and that it is easily found on the company website. Ensure that the policy provides a clear overview on how vulnerabilities can be communicated securely and how they'll be followed up on. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.1.6** | Verify that users and relevant stakeholders are informed when vulnerabilities affect products through established communication channels (website, e-mail, security advisory pages, changelogs, etc.). | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |


### Supply Chain
| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 |
| -- | ---------------------- | - | - | - |
| **1.2.1** | Verify that each application (including firmware) in the ecosystem maintains a software bill of materials (SBOM) cataloging third-party components, versioning, and published vulnerabilities. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.2.2** | Verify that potential areas of risk that come with the use of third-party and open-source software have been identified and that actions to mitigate such risks have been taken. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.2.3** | Verify the device is released with firmware configured with secure defaults appropriate for a release build (as opposed to debug versions). | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.2.4** | Verify that access to debugging interfaces (e.g. JTAG, SWD) is disabled or protected before shipping the device. Processors may refer to this as code protection, read back protection, CodeGuard, or access port protection. | | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.2.5** | Verify that debug capabilities in FPGAs are disabled on production PCBs. | | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.2.6** | Verify that devices are provisioned with a cryptographic root of trust that is hardware-based and immutable. | | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.2.7** | Verify that code integrity protection mechanisms are enabled and locked in hardware before shipping the device to customers. For example, ensure secure boot is enabled and the boot configuration locked. | | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.2.8** | Verify third-party code and components are analyzed using static analysis tools to ensure backdoors are not introduced. | | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.2.9** | Verify that all components including semiconductor drivers, SDKs, and modules (5G, LTE, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee) can be updated to provide security patches in alignment with the product's support or end-of-life policy. | | ✓ | ✓ |

### Secure Development

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 |
